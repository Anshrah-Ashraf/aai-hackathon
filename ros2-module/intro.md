# The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the ROS2 Robotic Nervous System module! This educational resource introduces ROS 2 as the middleware connecting AI agents to humanoid robots.

## Overview

This module is designed for CS/AI students with basic Python knowledge. You'll learn about:

- **ROS 2 Core Concepts**: Understanding the purpose, nodes, topics, and services
- **Python Agents with rclpy**: Creating Python-based ROS 2 nodes that bridge AI logic to robot controllers
- **Humanoid Description with URDF**: Understanding URDF role, structure, links, joints, and kinematics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the purpose of ROS 2 and identify its core components (nodes, topics, services)
- Create and run a basic Python-based ROS 2 node that communicates with simulated robot controllers
- Read and understand a URDF file, identifying links, joints, and kinematic properties of a humanoid robot
- Articulate how ROS 2 serves as middleware connecting AI agents to humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with fundamental programming concepts
- Interest in robotics and AI integration

Let's begin exploring how ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" for robotic applications!
