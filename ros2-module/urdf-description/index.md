# Humanoid Description with URDF

This chapter covers the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), which is used to describe robot models in ROS. You'll learn about URDF's role and structure, how to define links and joints for kinematics, and how to connect URDF models to simulation and control systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the role and structure of URDF in robot modeling
- Define robot links, joints, and kinematic properties
- Connect URDF models to simulation and control systems
- Apply URDF concepts to humanoid robot description

## Table of Contents

1. [URDF Role and Structure](./urdf-structure.md) - Understanding the purpose and XML structure of URDF
2. [Links, Joints, and Kinematics](./links-joints-kinematics.md) - Defining robot components and their relationships
3. [Connection to Simulation and Control](./simulation-control.md) - Integrating URDF with simulation and control systems

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 core concepts (from Chapter 1)
- Basic knowledge of XML format
- Familiarity with 3D coordinate systems and transformations

## Duration

Estimated time to complete: 75 minutes

Let's begin by exploring the role and structure of URDF in robot modeling.
