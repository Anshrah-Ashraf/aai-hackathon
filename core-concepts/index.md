# ROS 2 Core Concepts

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, the middleware that enables communication between different components of a robotic system.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain the purpose of ROS 2 in robotic systems
- Identify and describe the core components: nodes, topics, and services
- Understand how robot communication flows through the ROS 2 middleware
- Apply these concepts to connect AI agents to robots

## Table of Contents

1. [ROS 2 Purpose](./purpose.md) - Understanding why ROS 2 exists and its role in robotics
2. [Nodes, Topics, Services](./nodes-topics-services.md) - Core communication patterns in ROS 2
3. [Robot Communication Flow](./communication-flow.md) - How information moves through ROS 2 systems

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of software architecture concepts
- Familiarity with client-server or publisher-subscriber patterns (helpful but not required)

## Duration

Estimated time to complete: 60 minutes

Let's begin by exploring the purpose of ROS 2 and why it has become the standard middleware for robotics development.
