# Isaac Sim Assessment

Test your understanding of NVIDIA Isaac Sim concepts with these assessment questions.

## Multiple Choice Questions

1. What is the primary purpose of domain randomization in Isaac Sim?
   - A) To reduce computational requirements
   - B) To improve model robustness by exposing it to diverse scenarios
   - C) To simplify the simulation environment
   - D) To decrease the need for real-world data

   **Correct Answer: B** - Domain randomization improves model robustness by exposing it to diverse scenarios during training.

2. Which NVIDIA technology powers the photorealistic rendering in Isaac Sim?
   - A) CUDA cores only
   - B) RTX technology with real-time ray tracing
   - C) PhysX engine exclusively
   - D) Omniverse platform only

   **Correct Answer: B** - Isaac Sim uses RTX technology with real-time ray tracing for photorealistic rendering.

3. What is the main difference between training and testing environments in Isaac Sim?
   - A) Training environments are always larger than testing environments
   - B) Training environments use domain randomization while testing environments mirror real-world conditions
   - C) Testing environments are more colorful than training environments
   - D) There is no difference between the two

   **Correct Answer: B** - Training environments use domain randomization for model robustness, while testing environments mirror real-world conditions for performance evaluation.

4. Which of the following is NOT an advantage of synthetic data generation in Isaac Sim?
   - A) Automatic annotation and labeling
   - B) Cost and time efficiency
   - C) Elimination of privacy concerns
