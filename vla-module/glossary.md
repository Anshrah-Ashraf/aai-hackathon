# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module to ensure consistent understanding and terminology alignment.

## VLA-Related Terms

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems
Integrated AI systems that combine visual perception, natural language understanding, and robotic action in a unified framework, enabling robots to perceive their environment, understand human instructions in natural language, and execute appropriate actions.

### Joint Embedding Spaces
Representational spaces where visual, linguistic, and action-related information are mapped to a common format, allowing for cross-modal understanding and reasoning in VLA systems.

### Perception-to-Action Loops
Continuous feedback processes in robotic systems where perception informs action, action changes the environment which is then perceived again, creating a closed loop of interaction.

### Multi-Modal Fusion
The process of combining information from multiple sensory modalities (e.g., vision, language) to create a more comprehensive understanding than any single modality could provide.

## ROS 2-Related Terms

### ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
A flexible framework for writing robotic software that provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more.

### Action Server
A ROS 2 component that handles long-running tasks with feedback and goal management capabilities, suitable for complex robotic actions.

### Service
A ROS 2 communication pattern for short-lived requests with immediate responses, used for simple commands that execute quickly.

### Topic
A ROS 2 communication mechanism for continuous data streams, used for real-time control and monitoring.

## LLM-Related Terms

### Large Language Model (LLM)
A type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like language, and performing reasoning tasks.

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
A technique that encourages an LLM to explicitly show its reasoning process by breaking down complex tasks into sequential steps.

### Prompt Engineering
The practice of designing and refining input prompts to elicit desired responses from large language models.

### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
A subfield of natural language processing focused on enabling machines to comprehend and interpret human language in a meaningful way.

## Robotics-Related Terms

### Task Decomposition
The process of breaking down complex goals or tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel.

### Autonomous Behavior
Robot behavior that occurs without direct human control, where the robot makes decisions and executes actions based on its own perception and reasoning.

### Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
The study and practice of how humans and robots communicate and work together, including the design of interfaces and interaction protocols.
