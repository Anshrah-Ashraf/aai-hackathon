# Create ROS2 Module Tasks

## User Input
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary
Created comprehensive task list (tasks.md) for the ROS2 Robotic Nervous System educational module with 39 specific tasks organized by user story, following the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome
Successfully generated a detailed task breakdown that maps to the three user stories from the specification, with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Evaluation
The task list follows the required format with proper checkboxes, IDs, and story labels. All tasks are specific with exact file paths and organized by user story priority. The implementation strategy supports both sequential and parallel execution approaches.
