# Create ROS2 Robotic Nervous System Spec

## User Input
```
Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Purpose:
Specify Module 1 as a Docusaurus module with three chapters introducing ROS 2 as the middleware connecting AI agents to humanoid robots.

Audience:
CS / AI students with basic Python knowledge.

Chapters:

ROS 2 Core Concepts

ROS 2 purpose

Nodes, Topics, Services

Robot communication flow

Python Agents with rclpy

Python-based ROS 2 nodes

Bridging AI logic to robot controllers

Agent-to-actuator communication

Humanoid Description with URDF

URDF role and structure

Links, joints, kinematics

Connection to simulation and control
```

## Response Summary
Created comprehensive specification document (specs/1-ros2-robotic-nervous-system/spec.md) that captures all requirements for the ROS2 educational module, including user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria aligned with learning objectives.

## Outcome
Successfully created a detailed specification for the ROS2 Robotic Nervous System educational module that will guide development of the Docusaurus-based learning content focused on connecting AI agents to humanoid robots via ROS 2.

## Evaluation
The specification addresses all specified requirements including the three chapters on ROS 2 Core Concepts, Python Agents with rclpy, and Humanoid Description with URDF. All learning objectives are reflected in the functional requirements and success criteria, with measurable outcomes for student comprehension.
