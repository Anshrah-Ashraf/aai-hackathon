# Create ROS2 Module Plan

## User Input
```
-Initialize Docusaurus project, configure sidebar, and set tech stack to Docusaurus; all content files will be written in '.md'.
-Create module 1 with 3 chapters as Markdown files and register them in Docusaurus docs structure.
```

## Response Summary
Created comprehensive implementation plan for the ROS2 Robotic Nervous System educational module, including plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and content API contract for the Docusaurus-based educational content.

## Outcome
Successfully created a complete planning package for the Docusaurus-based ROS2 educational module that follows the spec-first methodology and is ready for implementation according to the project constitution.

## Evaluation
The plan addresses all specified requirements including Docusaurus initialization, three-chapter structure, and proper content organization. All artifacts align with constitutional principles of modular, spec-mapped content and free-tier infrastructure.
