## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task breakdown for Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module with 32 specific, actionable tasks organized by priority and user story. Tasks follow sequential chapter development approach with Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundational) → Phase 3 (US1-P1) → Phase 4 (US2-P2) → Phase 5 (US3-P3) → Final Phase (Polish).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown with 32 actionable items organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3) following concept-first approach
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md) with structured tasks for VLA module implementation
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase with /sp.implement or manual task execution
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown successfully addresses all specification requirements with proper prioritization and user story alignment

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PowerShell script unavailable, needed to create tasks manually; All user stories and requirements properly mapped to specific tasks
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Task breakdown created with proper structure and user story alignment
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing Phase 1 setup tasks
