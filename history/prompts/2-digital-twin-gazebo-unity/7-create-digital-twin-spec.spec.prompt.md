Constraints:

No real hardware

No advanced AI perception models

No ROS navigat
```

## Response Summary
Created comprehensive specification document (specs/2-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/spec.md) that captures all requirements for the Digital Twin educational module, including user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria aligned with learning objectives.

## Outcome
Successfully created a detailed specification for the Digital Twin educational module covering Gazebo physics simulation, Unity high-fidelity rendering, and sensor simulation concepts.

## Evaluation
The specification addresses all specified requirements including the three chapters on Physics Simulation with Gazebo, Environment & Interaction in Unity, and Sensor Simulation. All learning objectives are reflected in the functional requirements and success criteria, with measurable outcomes for student comprehension.
