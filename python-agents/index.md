# Python Agents with rclpy

This chapter focuses on creating Python-based ROS 2 nodes using rclpy, the Python client library for ROS 2. You'll learn how to bridge AI logic to robot controllers and implement agent-to-actuator communication for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Use rclpy to create Python-based ROS 2 nodes
- Implement communication between AI agents and robot controllers
- Create effective agent-to-actuator communication patterns
- Apply these concepts to humanoid robot control

## Table of Contents

1. [rclpy Basics](./rclpy-basics.md) - Introduction to the Python client library for ROS 2
2. [Python-based ROS 2 Nodes](./python-nodes.md) - Creating nodes in Python with rclpy
3. [Bridging AI Logic to Robot Controllers](./ai-robot-bridge.md) - Connecting AI decision-making to robot control
4. [Agent-to-Actuator Communication](./agent-actuator-communication.md) - Implementing communication patterns for actuator control

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of ROS 2 core concepts (from Chapter 1)
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts

## Duration

Estimated time to complete: 90 minutes

Let's begin by exploring the rclpy library, which provides Python access to ROS 2 functionality.
